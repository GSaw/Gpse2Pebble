# Gpse2Pebble Android Service.
Bridge between GPS Essentials  and Pebble watch face. 
The Android service reads the data from sqlite database file of the GPS Essentials app 
and pushes the data to pebble watch face (see another mine project on github). 
The sunrise and sunset times are calculated using 
https://github.com/mikereedell/sunrisesunsetlib-java. (hopefuly i didnt violate any licences).

I just put together source code found on stackoverflow, in Android sdk and so on. 

I do not have enough time until my vocation.
